How to play
===========

Drag gems horizontally or vertically to create matches of 3 or more gems of the same colour. You must reach the indicated score within the indicated number of moves to progress through levels. White gems increase your score multiplier, increasing the number of points you get from matches. Purple gems reduce your score. Yellow gems increase the number of moves you have to complete the level. Other gems increase your score. Of these other gems, one will be randomly chosen at the beginning of each level (the "best gem") that will be worth more points. Another will be chosen (the "worst gem") that will be worth less.
